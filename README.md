## Project Title: Examining Discrimination in the Prediction of Loan Default: An Experimental Approach

## Project Overview: This project aims to examine whether AI-driven decision-making systems in loan management exhibit any discriminatory patterns in loan default prediction, contributing to the understanding of fairness and equity in financial decision-making processes.

## Data Sources: The dataset named 'Loan Default', a csv file was sourced from Kaggle, an online community platform open to the public. The dataset contains 148670 rows and 34 features.

### Tools Used
---
-Jupyter Notebook 
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Analysis
3. For Visualization
4. Overleaf  

-Github for portfolio building

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following steps;
  1. Data loading and Inspection
  2. Handling of Missing variables
  3. Feature Engineering
  4. Label Encoding
  5. Feature Selection
  6. Data Standardization
  7. Data Spliting
  8. Model Development

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
-Univariate Analysis
1. Box plot
2. Histogram
3. Bar chart

-Bivariate Analysis

### Data Analysis
---
For the purpose of this analysis, five algorithms were used:: 
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
The analysis was conducted both before and after undersampling to address class imbalance in the dataset. Both traditional algorithms and fairness-aware algorithms were applied, and the results were compared to evaluate the impact of fairness considerations on model performance.
